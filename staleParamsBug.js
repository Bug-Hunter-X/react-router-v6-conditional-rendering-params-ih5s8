In React Router Dom v6, using the `useParams` hook inside a component that's rendered conditionally (e.g., based on a route match) can lead to unexpected behavior.  If the component is unmounted and then remounted due to a route change or conditional rendering, `useParams` might not update correctly, resulting in stale parameter values. This is particularly problematic when switching between routes with overlapping paths.
